## Rcalendar

A simple $R$ package containing a *lookup* table between different ways of expressing dates for the years between 1970 and 2025.

You don't actually need $R$ installed, as you can just download the `calendar.csv` file from the `data-raw/csv` sub folder.

In the same folder you can also find the following tables: 
- `uk_holidays` with the British Bank holidays 
- `seasons` with the starting days of the astronomical seasons (thanks to [Jay Tanner](https://neoprogrammics.com/equinoxes_and_solstices/Equinoxes_and_Solstices_Calculator.php)) 
- `metadata` with the description of all the columns in the other datasets
