## Rcalendar

A simple $R$ package containing a lookup table between different ways of expressing dates for the years between 1970 and 2025. 

You don't actually need $R$ installed, as you can just download the `calendar.csv` file from the `data-raw/csv` subfolder. In the sane folder you can also find the datasets:
- `uk_holidays` with the British Bank holidays
- `seasons` with the starting days of the astronomical seasons
